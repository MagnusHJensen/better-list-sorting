     * compare(x, y)} must throw an exception if and only if {@code
     * compare(y, x)} throws an exception.)<p>
     * <p>
     * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
     * {@code ((compare(x, y)>0) && (compare(y, z)>0))} implies
     * {@code compare(x, z)>0}.<p>
     * <p>
     * Finally, the implementor must ensure that {@code compare(x,
     * y)==0} implies that {@code signum(compare(x,
     * z))==signum(compare(y, z))} for all {@code z}.

     * second.
     * @throws NullPointerException if an argument is null and this
     *                              comparator does not permit null arguments
     * @throws ClassCastException   if the arguments' types prevent them from
     *                              being compared by this comparator.
     * @apiNote It is generally the case, but <i>not</i> strictly required that
     * {@code (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y))}.  Generally speaking,
     * any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate
     * this fact.  The recommended language is "Note: this comparator
